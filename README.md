Hi there, I'm Ariel! I am a software engineer, UI/UX designer, and computer science student passionate about technology and its ability to make the world a better place. I strive to craft intuitive, memorable experiences for people&mdash;to realize the full potential of technology to improve our world.

Currently, I am studying computer science and business at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [Raikes School](https://raikes.unl.edu/). After graduation in May, I will join [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/company/about-garmin/) as a frontend software engineer, where I am excited to keep learning and growing my skills!
