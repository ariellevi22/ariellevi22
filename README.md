## About Me

Hi, I'm Ariel! I am a software engineer passionate about building technology to make the world a better place. I craft web applications with a focus on clean code, beautiful design, and intuitive user experiences.

As a software engineer at [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/company/about-garmin/), I work with incredibly talented teammates to build [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/), helping millions of people gain insights into their health and well-being. My technical proficiency revolves around React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express.js on the backend, but I am always looking for new ways to learn and expand my skills!
