# Ariel Levi

Hi there, I'm Ariel! I am a software engineer and UI/UX designer passionate about technology and its ability to make the world a better place. I strive to craft intuitive, memorable experiences for people&mdash;to realize the full potential of technology to improve our world.

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and minors in Business and Math from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [Raikes School](https://raikes.unl.edu/). In August, I will join [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/company/about-garmin/) as a front-end software engineer, where I am excited to keep learning and growing my skills!

Learn more about me through my [personal portfolio website](https://alevi22.github.io/) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-levi/).
